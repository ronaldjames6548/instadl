## How to Protect an Instagram Account

Well, there are many loopholes that people exploit to hack your Instagram account. You should know where to be strong and cautious about your account. In this chapter, we will explore how you can protect your account from these unknown threats. If you prioritize your Instagram account, read below carefully.

### Strong Password

Start with a strong and unique password. Combine letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like your name or birthdate. You can use Google Suggest passwords to help you create a strong password for your account. However, it's always suggested not to save your password on your device or Google account, as it's not a secure step.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Instagram offers 2FA as an added layer of security. Link your account to your phone number or a dedicated authentication app for an extra verification step when logging in. This way, you can secure your account without any trouble, and you'll be notified if someone tries to log in. Enabling 2FA is easy; go to Instagram settings, click on Privacy and Security, then scroll down to Two-factor authentication, and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Be Cautious with Third-Party Apps

Be selective about which third-party applications you grant access to your Instagram account. Only use trusted and reputable apps, and review the permissions they request before authorizing access. Many third-party apps may be required for account management, but make sure to know the app's background before installing it on your device.

### Keep Your Email Secure

If you use your Google account on the Internet, securing your Gmail address is a top priority. Add your email to your Instagram account and enable 2FA for your email as well. Be cautious about clicking on any suspicious links in your email that may not be safe for your account.

### Beware of Phishing Attempts

Be cautious when clicking on links or providing personal information online. Verify the authenticity of any emails or messages claiming to be from Instagram. Don't open any links or URLs that are not from the official Instagram.

### Log Out of Shared Devices

If you have shared your account with someone, check their daily activity and log out from shared devices for added security. Using a VPN service when logged in can also enhance your account's safety.

### Monitor Account Activity

Regularly review your account activity for any suspicious logins or unauthorized changes. Instagram provides tools to see where and when your account was accessed. If you notice any suspicious activity, report it as soon as possible, especially for business accounts that may be targeted by attackers.

### Educate Yourself

Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices for online safety. Being aware of potential risks is one of the best ways to protect yourself. Check the Instagram security blog to learn more about securing your Instagram account and stay updated with live information.

It's also recommended to create a second account connected to your main account, allowing people to follow both. Having a second option is beneficial, especially if your business relies on Instagram.

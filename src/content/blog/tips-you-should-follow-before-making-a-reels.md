## 7 Most Useful Tips

Generally, there are many rules Instagram has to follow before sharing anything on their social platform. But you also need to take care of your content quality before posting it, as you expect lots of likes and views from the reels.

### Know Your Content

Instagram's algorithm always keeps an eye on your content. You should know about your content typeâ€”whether it entertains, informs, inspires, or promotes a product or service. Be specific about your content, which will help rank your reel and be convenient for your followers. Knowing your goal will help shape the content.

### What Your Audience Wants

Try to know what your audience wants from you and keep posting related to your viral or highly-watched reels. This will help make your followers active and amazed. You can also make a reel with trending music to grow your reels faster.

### Use Vertical Format

Instagram's most used OS is mobile devices like Android or iOS. Therefore, always make content in a vertical format, which is also recommended by Instagram. Most recommended videos on Instagram are in a vertical format, so export your reels video in 1080 pixels wide and 1920 pixels tall.

### Good Lighting

Following all the rules and terms of Instagram sharing your reel is not enough for ranking your reel video. To make your reels viral and popular, you also must improve your content quality with good lighting. Use apps like Alight Motion to increase your video quality.

### Clear Audio

Make sure your audio quality is clear and fresh, as people love listening to and sharing clear audio. If you don't have a good mic device, use an advanced web tool like Adobe Enhance Speech to improve your audio quality.

### Editing Skills

With good music or audio, you also need a good quality video for people to love watching your reels. Ensure your video has enough quality. In social media, to be first, you must be skilled in your field, and video editing skills are also required. If someone finds your video informative or attractive with good editing, they will start following you instantly.

### Hashtags and Descriptions

Share your reels with good and trending hashtags, which will help users know about your reel concept. It's always good to include a link related to your content in the description. For example, if you are sharing an informative video about a country, add a Wikipedia link to your reels description so people can validate your information.

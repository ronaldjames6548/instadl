## For Your Personal Account

If you are on Instagram for enjoying your free time and following your favorite people, you don't need to make a business account. With a personal account, you can share your content and private your account too. To manage your personal and business accounts, you can take some precautions that will definitely be worth it for you.

### Create a Separate Personal Account

If you don't already have a personal Instagram account, create one using a different email address. This will keep your personal life separate from your business endeavors. You can make a personal account with your mobile number and a business account with a separate email ID.

### Set Privacy Preferences

Depending on your comfort level, you can keep your personal account private to control who can follow you. This allows you to maintain a level of privacy. Set your account to private mode if you don't want to show off your personal information for public attention.

### Choose a Username and Profile Photo

To make an Instagram account, choose a specific username and fully customize it with your bio link and a short description of your account. Select a username and profile photo that reflects your personal brand and identity.

### Post Personal Content

Share personal photos, thoughts, and experiences with your friends and family. Keep this content separate from your business-related posts. In your personal account, you can share your daily life, short blog, or about your skills to get more followers.

### Engage Authentically

Interact with your personal connections genuinely. Like and comment on their posts, and respond to comments on your posts. With your personal account, you can share lots of information and videos in reel format, which will help you gain lots of followers. You can also get paid promotions with your account.

## For Your Business Account

Now let's know how you can manage your Instagram business account like a pro user. It's not easy to manage a business account on Instagram if you don't know anything about it. It can be very helpful for beginners who don't have any knowledge about how to manage an Instagram business account.

### Set Up a Business Account

If you haven't already, convert your Instagram profile to a business account. This provides access to analytics and allows you to promote your content. If you want to sell something online using social platforms like Instagram, then you should open a business account. It also allows users to create a shopping store.

### Separate Email Addresses

Use a different email address for your business account to keep it distinct from your personal one. Follow using separate emails for both personal and business accounts. Create a new email using your phone number if you don't have a fresh email address.

### Optimize Your Profile

Create a professional and appealing profile with a clear business name, a logo or professional photo, and a concise bio that explains your business and its offerings. Make your business account look different with a high-quality profile photo that will make your business stand out. Add your genuine business email address or phone number to make your business account trusted.

### Schedule Posts

Use Instagram scheduling tools to plan and schedule your business posts ahead of time. Consistency is key for engagement. By scheduling your posts, you can make your users excited and get more attention for your posts.

## Hashtags and Location Tags

Research and use relevant hashtags and location tags to increase the discoverability of your business posts. Using hashtags and location tags works like SEO for any Instagram reels and posts, helping to reach more people around the world. Before using hashtags, try to research and use tags related to trending topics.

## Interact Professionally

Respond to comments and messages from customers or potential clients in a professional manner. Use the DM feature for business-related inquiries. Give priority to your audience or followers by commenting back and replying to DMs. Also, try to understand what your audience wants from you.

## Run Ads and Promotions

If it aligns with your business goals, consider running paid advertising campaigns and promotions to reach a broader audience. If you are selling something on Instagram, you should run ads to promote your products with high-quality content that looks original and genuine.

## Managing Both Accounts

To manage both accounts, use two different devices like your PC and mobile, which will be easy to manage and not a confusing task. Here are some basic tips you can follow to manage both accounts.

## Balance Your Time

Allocate specific times for managing each account. Set boundaries to avoid being overwhelmed by social media. Set a timetable for both accounts to help you keep a balance and appear as a trusted account.

## Use Scheduling Tools

Utilize social media management tools that allow you to schedule posts, making it easier to manage both accounts efficiently. Scheduling tools for Instagram are third-party applications or services that allow you to plan and schedule your Instagram posts in advance. These tools are particularly useful for businesses, brands, and social media managers, as they streamline the posting process and help maintain a consistent content calendar.

### Delegate Responsibilities

If you have a team, delegate tasks related to social media management for your business account, so you can focus on your personal account. Delegating responsibilities on Instagram means assigning specific tasks related to managing and maintaining your Instagram account to others, often team members or collaborators, to share the workload and responsibilities. Delegating can be especially important for businesses or individuals with a significant online presence who want to ensure consistent posting, engagement, and content quality.
